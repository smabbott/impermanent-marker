          <p>The idea that one should be careful about what they post online has ingrained itself into the collective wisdom as firmly as any piece of advice doled out to the young and naïve. “Brush your teeth twice a day, look both ways before crossing the street and don't post compromising photos of yourself on Facebook—it will be there forever!”</p>
          <p>While sound in principle and practical for an interconnected, digital life, it is not without hyperbole. “Forever”? Really? What is this magic force that you wield, internet, which shields the delicate bytes of so many youthful indiscretions from the relentless erosion that time normally brings to all things? Have we all forgotten that the sun will stop burning in just a few billion years? It is even conceivable that Facebook may not last that long. Have a sense of perspective! “Indefinite”, is perhaps the word that the parents and tellers of cautionary tales of today are looking for.</p>
          <p>Semantics aside, is it not a bit absurd to expect that the data we push into the ether is stable even for a relatively long time? Sure, it is increasingly the standard that servers and hard drives all operate in ecosystems of redundant backups, but are these systems infallible? Are the companies that own and operate these systems not subject to the same perils that any other organization is? Do they not rise and fall? And what of the societies that support those organizations? Do they not come and go?</p>
          <p>And what of interest? Does anyone, even now, care what I may have been up to on one particular night in college? Are our lives under such scrutiny? Do our potential employers really have so much free time on their hands that they can mine social media for dirt. Are we all presidential candidates undergoing the vetting process?</p>
          <p>Lack of interest is compounded by the sheer volume of other things on the internet. Things drop out of view, and are gradually buried under layers and layers of other things.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the longevity of our data, given the volatility of the environment in which it exists, it is impressive that anything sticks around as long as it does.</p>
          <p>Any given physical component that makes up the internet is subject to all the same problems that any other media that we may use to record our thoughts and activities. What is it that makes this medium stand out more than others? Is it the relative newness and unfamiliarity that comes with new things? Is it the mystery of what happens behind the screen and on the other end of the wire? Is it that there is a sense of loss of control when our bytes are uploaded to someone else's server?</p>
          <p>Maybe it is the speed that differentiates digital media from other forms. Not so long ago long-distance communication happened primarily through paper and ink. There was an inherent thoughtfulness enforced on the writer given the physical limits of writing a message by hand and dropping it into the post. Has it become too easy to unleash the firehose of thought on anyone who is listening? Is the convenience of technology eroding the inner filter?</p>
          <p>“Forever” is a word with a very specific and unequivocal meaning. It is so far removed from human experience that it's use should be rare. Yet it is thrown around with such familiarity that anything short of universal recognition of the concept is unthinkable.</p>
          <p>Our relationship with “forever”, whether measured on human, geological or astronomical scales, is a story about trying to freeze time, trying to preserve what we believe to be valuable. It is about our own mortality and the search for something larger than ourselves.</p>
          <p>We have ways of making things stick around for a while but ultimately, whether due to waning interest, information overload or natural processes, nothing can be considered truly permanent. Forever is something we cannot touch. It is outside of the human experience.</p>
          <p>The limit of our reach should not be seen as a shortcoming. It is part of what makes us human. It is a thing to be embraced.</p>
          <p>This site is a (temporary) home for writing about the impossibility of forever. It is an archiveless blog hosting one article at a time. Here we will explore the ephemeral, embrace obsolescence and celebrate impermanence.</p>
