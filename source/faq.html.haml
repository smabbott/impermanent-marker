  %dd No. We do not save articles. Not anywhere. Not on paper, not on in a private hard drive, not on a floppy diskâ€¦ 

  %dt Is that really true?
  %dd Yes. Sort of. There is possibly a computer, laptop, mobile device or server somewhere that has cached or still holds in mempry any given issue. The chance of getting a hold of that data is small.
