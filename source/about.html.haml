  %p The Impermanent Marker is a (temporary) home for writing about ephemeral and obsolescent thingsâ€”a place to embrace and celebrate impermanence. It is an archiveless blog, hosting one article at a time. With each new article that is published, the previous article is deleted, never to be read again.
